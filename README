Original approach:
Overall my original approach was fine, one thing I had to change was how
I handled placing pieces. My original plan was to get a list of the valid
moves for the current player, but this seemed in effecient. So I just
validated whatever move the user passed in. Other than that is was the same
as my preliminary. 

Kernel Modules:
Kernel modules were tricky at first. I got up to the point where I could open
my device and run it, but had trouble figuring out how to parse the command 
that the user entered. I got stuck to the point where I just left that issue
for a couple of days to just focus on programming the game itself. So I decided
to code reversi in userspace. This helped me alot since when I fully figured out
the command parsing, I could just place what I made in my userspace. Coding the 
game in userspace took me about 10 hours. 

I'll stop this README short since I know you had to read our final document also :)
